# DHT22

Programs for temperature and humidity sensor using Adafruit Feather 32u4 LoRa Radio and DHT22.

## Sending measured values to TTS

We have prepared four programs for measuring temperature and humidity. The first program sends the current measured values. The second program sends averages of measured values over a certain period of time. The other two programs extend the first two with a low power mode, which is great when you run this sensor on battery power.

### Programs
- Current measured values
- Averages of measured values
- Current measured values with low power mode
- Averages of measured values with low power mode
