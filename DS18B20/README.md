# DS18B20

Programs for temperature sensor using Adafruit Feather 32u4 LoRa Radio and DS18B20.

## Sending measured values to TTS

We have prepared four programs for measuring temperature. The first program sends the current measured values. The second program sends averages of measured values over a certain period of time. The other two programs extend the first two with a low power mode, which is great when you run this sensor on battery power.

### Programs
- Current measured values
- Averages of measured values - will be added
- Current measured values with low power mode - will be added
- Averages of measured values with low power mode - will be added
